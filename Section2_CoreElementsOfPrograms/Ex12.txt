Here is some code:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Code Sample

	iteration = 0
	count = 0
	while iteration < 5:
		for letter in "hello, world":
			count += 1
		print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
		iteration += 1

---------------------------------------------------------------------

We wish to re-write the above code, but instead of nesting a 'for' loop inside a 'while' loop, we want to nest a 'while' loop inside a 'for' loop. Which of the following loops gives the same output as the Code Sample?

Try to answer the following questions by just reading the code. Reading code is a very good skill to have (and will help you both in your programming career and on your exams!). It is okay to check your answers that you obtain from just reading the code, then in your interpreter run the code for the ones you got wrong on your first attempt.

Options:Yes, Test # gives the same output as the Code Sample
		No, Test # does not give the same output as the Code Sample

Q1: Test 1
	for iteration in range(5):
    count = 0
    while True:
        for letter in "hello, world":
            count += 1
        print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
A1: No, Test # does not give the same output as the Code Sample

Q2: Test 2
	for iteration in range(5):
		count = 0
		while True:
			for letter in "hello, world":
				count += 1
			print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
			break
A2: No, Test # does not give the same output as the Code Sample

Q3: Test 3
	count = 0
	phrase = "hello, world"
	for iteration in range(5):
		index = 0
		while index < len(phrase):
			count += 1
			index += 1
		print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
A3: Yes, Test # gives the same output as the Code Sample

Q4: Test 4
	count = 0
	phrase = "hello, world"
	for iteration in range(5):
		while True:
			count += len(phrase)
			break
		print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
A4: Yes, Test # gives the same output as the Code Sample

Q5: Test 5
	count = 0
	phrase = "hello, world"
	for iteration in range(5):
		count += len(phrase)
		print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
A5: Yes, Test # gives the same output as the Code Sample
