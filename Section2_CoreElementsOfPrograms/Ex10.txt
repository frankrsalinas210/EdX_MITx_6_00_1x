Below are some short Python programs. For each program, answer the associated question.

Try to answer the questions without running the code. Check your answers, then run the code for the ones you get wrong.

This question is going to ask you what some simple loops print out. If you're asked what code like this prints:

	num = 5
	if num > 2:
		print(num)
		num -= 1
	print(num)

write what it prints out, separating what appears on a new line by a comma and a space. So the answer for the above code would be:

	5, 4

If a given loop will not terminate, write the phrase 'infinite loop' in the box.

Note: Using the 'range' built-in function
The standard way of using the range function is to give it a number to stop at, and 'range' will give a sequence of values that start at 0 and go through the stop value minus 1. For example, calling 'range(stop)' yields the following:

	>>> range(5)
	range(0,5)
which is the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
However, we can call range with some additional, optional parameters - a value to start at, and a step size. You can specify a start value by calling 'range(start, stop)', like this:

	>>> range(2, 5)
	range(2, 5)
which is the sequence of values 2, 3, 4
To specify a step size, you must specify a start value - the call is 'range(start, stop, stepSize)', like this:

	>>> range(2, 10, 2)
	range(2, 10, 2)
which gives the sequence of values 2, 4, 6, 8
Note that these parameters - start, stop, stepSize - are the same parameters that you can use when slicing a string:

>>> s = "Hello, world!"
>>> s[1:] # s[start:]
ello, world!
>>> s[1:10] # s[start:stop]
ello, wor
>>> s[1:10:3] # s[start:stop:stepSize]
eow
In this problem you'll get more practice on using range.

Q1:	num = 10
	for num in range(5):
		print(num)
	print(num)
A1:	0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4

Q2:	divisor = 2
	for num in range(0, 10, 2):
		print(num/divisor) 
A2:	0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0

Q3:	for variable in range(20):
		if variable % 4 == 0:
			print(variable)
		if variable % 16 == 0:
			print('Foo!') 
A3:	0, Foo!, 4, 8, 12, 16, Foo!

Q4:	for letter in 'hola':
		print(letter)  
A4:	h, o, l, a

Q5:	count = 0
	for letter in 'Snow!':
		print('Letter # ' + str(count) + ' is ' + str(letter))
		count += 1
		break
	print(count)
A5:	Letter # 0 is S, 1
