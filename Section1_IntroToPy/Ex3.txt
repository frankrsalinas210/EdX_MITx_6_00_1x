Q.1) True or False? A stored program computer is designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile.

A.1) False

Q.2) True or False? A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it.

A.2) False

Q.3) A program counter
		a)	counts the number of primitive operations executed by the program.
		b)	counts the number of primitive operations comprising a complex operation.
		c)	points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program.
		d)	remembers how many times a program has been executed.
		
A.3) c)	points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program.

Q.4) What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation"?
		a)	The computer tests each instruction to ensure it will not harm the circuitry.
		b)	The computer executes the instructions in strict, linear sequence, just like walking in a straight line.
		c)	The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.
		d)	The computer slowly executes instructions so that we can follow its progress, rather than running a program at full speed.
A.4) c)	The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.

Q.5) True or False? In order to compute everything that is computable, every computer must be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations.
		
A.5) False
