Problem 2

Assume 's' is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the number of times the string ''bob'' occurs in 's'. For example, if 's = 'azcbobobegghakl'', then your program should print

Number of times bob occurs is: 2

Assuing that I am being feed differnt 's'

A: bob = 0
	i = 0
	while i < (len(s)-2):
		if s[i:i+3] == 'bob':
			bob += 1
		i += 1
	print ("The Number of times bob occures is:", bob)
